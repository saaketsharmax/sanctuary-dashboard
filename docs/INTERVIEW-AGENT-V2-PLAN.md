# Interview Agent V2 — Plan of Action

**Objective:** Transform the Interview Agent from a good YC-style interviewer into a surgical startup assessment system that extracts deep primitives, understands founder dynamics, and generates actionable intelligence.

## Part 1: New Startup Primitives to Extract

### What are "Primitives"?

Primitives are the fundamental building blocks that determine startup success. Instead of surface-level answers, we extract the atomic units of truth.

## Part 3: Unique Questioning Techniques

### Technique 1: The Inversion Method
Instead of "Why will you succeed?", ask:
```
"If your startup fails in 18 months, what will be the reason?"
"What's the most likely way this doesn't work?"
"What would make you quit?"
```
**Why:** Forces intellectual honesty. Strong founders have thought about this deeply.

### Technique 2: The Time Machine Test
```
"It's 2029. You've won. Describe what the world looks like."
"It's 2029. You've failed. What happened?"
"Looking back from success, what was the turning point?"
```
**Why:** Reveals clarity of vision and self-awareness about risks.

### Technique 3: The User Story Immersion
```
"Pick one specific user. Give them a name. Walk me through their Tuesday."
"Show me the exact moment they feel the pain you're solving."
"What are they doing at 10:47am when they need you most?"
"What do they do immediately before and after using your product?"
```
**Why:** Tests whether founders truly understand their users at granular level.

### Technique 4: The Founder Chemistry Probe
```
"Tell me about your biggest disagreement with your co-founder. How did it resolve?"
"When was the last time you changed your mind because of something they said?"
"How do you make decisions when you disagree?"
"What does your co-founder think is YOUR biggest weakness?"
"If your co-founder quit tomorrow, what would you do?"
```
**Why:** Team breakdown is #1 startup killer. Surface the dynamics.

### Technique 5: The Second-Order Effects
```
"If you succeed, who loses?"
"What industry will you destroy? Who will fight back?"
"What's the unintended consequence of solving this problem?"
"What becomes possible that wasn't before?"
```
**Why:** Tests systems thinking and anticipation of resistance.

### Technique 6: The Evidence Tribunal
```
"You said users love it. Give me 3 specific quotes from the last week."
"You said it's painful. Quantify the pain in dollars or hours."
"You said you're growing. Show me the week-over-week numbers."
"You said they keep coming back. What's retention at day 7, 30, 90?"
```
**Why:** Separates narrative from data. Forces specificity.

### Technique 7: The Uncomfortable Truth
```
"What's the thing you're most afraid I'll ask about?"
"What do you tell investors that isn't quite true?"
"What would your harshest critic say about this idea?"
"What's the biggest lie you've told yourself about this startup?"
```
**Why:** Surfaces hidden concerns and tests integrity.

### Technique 8: The Insight Extraction
```
"What do you know about this problem that nobody else knows?"
"What's the secret that gives you an unfair advantage?"
"What did you learn from users that surprised you?"
"What's the non-obvious insight that makes this work?"
```
**Why:** Unique insights are the foundation of great startups.

### Technique 9: The Stress Test
```
"Your biggest competitor just raised $100M. What do you do?"
"Google launches a competing product tomorrow. Now what?"
"Your co-founder gets a $2M offer from Stripe. What happens?"
"You run out of money in 4 months. What's the plan?"
```
**Why:** Tests resilience and strategic thinking under pressure.

### Technique 10: The Love Test
```
"Who LOVES your product? Not likes—LOVES."
"What would your most passionate user say about you?"
"If you shut down tomorrow, who would be devastated? How many?"
"Show me a message from a user that made you emotional."
```
**Why:** Passion predicts retention. Love signals are leading indicators.

### Chemistry Interview Flow
```
1. "How did you meet your co-founder?"
   → Looking for: depth of relationship, shared history

2. "What's the equity split and how did you decide it?"
   → Looking for: fairness, process, settled vs. festering

3. "Tell me about your worst moment as a team."
   → Looking for: specific story, how they handled it, growth

4. "When did you last disagree? Walk me through it."
   → Looking for: healthy conflict, resolution process

5. "What does your co-founder do better than you?"
   → Looking for: genuine respect, self-awareness

6. "If I asked them your biggest weakness, what would they say?"
   → Looking for: honesty, vulnerability, communication

7. "Have you discussed what happens if one of you wants out?"
   → Looking for: mature planning, aligned expectations

## Part 6: Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1)
- [ ] Create new `interview-system-v2.ts` with upgraded prompts
- [ ] Define all primitive types in TypeScript
- [ ] Create new interview section flow

### Phase 2: Question Bank (Day 1-2)
- [ ] Write 10+ questions per dimension (80+ total)
- [ ] Tag questions by technique (inversion, evidence, stress test, etc.)
- [ ] Create follow-up question logic

### Phase 3: Chemistry Assessment (Day 2)
- [ ] Add dedicated co-founder chemistry section
- [ ] Create chemistry scoring rubric
- [ ] Build team dynamics extraction

### Phase 4: Signal Extraction (Day 2-3)
- [ ] Upgrade signal types to match new primitives
- [ ] Add real-time quote extraction
- [ ] Build risk/strength flagging logic

### Phase 5: Report Generation (Day 3)
- [ ] Create Startup DNA Report template
- [ ] Build automated report generation from signals
- [ ] Add recommendation engine

### Phase 6: Testing & Refinement (Day 3-4)
- [ ] Test with mock interviews
- [ ] Refine prompts based on output quality
- [ ] Optimize for consistency

## Part 7: Unique Sanctuary Additions

### Beyond YC: What Makes Sanctuary Special

1. **Community Fit Assessment**
   - Will they contribute to the Sanctuary community?
   - Are they collaborative or purely competitive?
   - Will they help other founders?

2. **Mentorship Readiness**
   - Are they coachable?
   - Do they listen or just pitch?
   - Can they articulate what help they need?

3. **Long-term Alignment**
   - Are they building to flip or to build something lasting?
   - Values alignment with Sanctuary mission?
   - Will they be a good alumni?

4. **Founder Wellbeing Signals**
   - Signs of burnout or unhealthy patterns?
   - Work-life awareness?
   - Support system in place?

## Part 8: Success Metrics for the Agent

How we know the upgrade worked:

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Primitives extracted per interview | ~10 | 30+ |
| Verbatim user quotes captured | ~2 | 5+ |
| Red flags identified | Generic | Specific + evidenced |
| Chemistry assessment | None | Full score + reasoning |
| Report completeness | Basic | Full DNA Report |
| Time to review for partners | 30 min | 5 min (report does heavy lifting) |

## Ready to Proceed?

This plan covers:
1. ✅ New primitives (7 categories, 40+ data points)
2. ✅ New dimensions (8 vs current 5)
3. ✅ Unique techniques (10 methods)
4. ✅ Founder chemistry (dedicated assessment)
5. ✅ Output structure (Startup DNA Report)
6. ✅ Implementation phases (6 phases)
7. ✅ Sanctuary-specific additions
8. ✅ Success metrics

**Estimated effort:** 3-4 focused sessions

**Next step:** Approve this plan, then I'll start building Phase 1 (Foundation + Question Bank)
